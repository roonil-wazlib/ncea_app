A project I worked on in highschool to store and track progress towards NCEA highschool qualifications. By allowing the user to enter goal and mock grades for each of their standards as well as final grades, mock external performance can be forcasted on top of internal performance to help students predict their end of year results and inform their studying. 

The code base isn't great to read but the project is open-source for any users that may want to make their own edits.
