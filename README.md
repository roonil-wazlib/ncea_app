If you want to use this code to help with your own
projects or learning feel free to download this project.


I am also more than happy for anyone to either suggest
improvements I could make, or offer their own that they
would like to add to the project. If you'd like to make
changes it'd be great if you let me know first so I can
confirm that it won't conflict with anything I'm doing,
but after that I'm more than happy to merge any improvements
or fixes that you come up with.
